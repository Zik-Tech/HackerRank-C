In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use  to represent true and  to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false,  or , for each bit compared.

Bitwise AND operator & The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1. If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0. It is denoted by &.

Bitwise OR operator | The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. It is denoted by |.

Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator ^ The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by .
